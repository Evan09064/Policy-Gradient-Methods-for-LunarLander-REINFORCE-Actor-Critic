# Policy-Gradient-Methods-for-LunarLander-REINFORCE-Actor-Critic
A PyTorch implementation of policy-based reinforcement learning for LunarLander-v2. Implements REINFORCE and multiple Actor-Critic variants (with bootstrap, baseline subtraction, and PPO) with hyperparameter tuning and experiments to analyze and compare policy gradient performance.
